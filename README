To use this (assuming you've cd'd into the directory:

0. (optional) make the checkout directory into a virtualenv

  $ virtualenv .
  $ source bin/activate

1. Install grpc

  $ pip install grpcio grpcio-tools

2. Run code generation step

  $ python gen_code.py

3. Run server and client

  $ python server.py &
  $ python client.py

Of course you can also simply run the server and client from different
terminals. You should see a little bit of deep wisdom on the screen, sent
from the server to the client. If not, something went wrong. If your
only complaint is that the wisdom isn't deep enough, please do not file a bug.
